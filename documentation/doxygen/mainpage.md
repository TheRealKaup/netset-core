# API Reference

The Doxygen documentation includes **only** and **exclusively** the API reference.

There may be more documentation to netset-core, and all of it is listed in [the Git repository's `readme.md` file](https://github.com/TheRealKaup/netset-core/blob/main/readme.md#documentation); the Doxygen reference is part of it.
